## Introduction

The Dubai Metro project is arguably the most **impressive looking** of its kind. Towering above the vehicles below, the massive viaducts elevate this transit system way above the noisy sea of honking steel and smoke. The stations are an ensemble of futuristic space invaders, who have set up their terminal bases & pipes of extraction on Earth's surface.

But anyone who plans to rely on this "rapid" transit system for day-to-day commuting probably wont wait to appreciate the manifest glamour. Also note that such niceties require volcanic deposits of money (yes, the investments are in flames, as we'll see later).

So how did the designers justify there elaborate aesthetic taste over mass-transit functionality?
